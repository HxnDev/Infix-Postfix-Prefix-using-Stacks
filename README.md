# Infix-Postfix-Prefix-using-Stacks

There are 1 header file and 1 cpp file. 

Header file is as follows:
Stack.h

CPP File is as follows:
Ass3.cpp

Stack.h will have all the functionality related to stacks and requiremnts whereas Ass3.cpp will be using stacks to run.

All the files have been commented for your ease. Furthermore you may also add further comments if you may. I have uploaded the Visual Studio project file too. You can simply run the project by running "Ass3.vcxproj".

For better understanding of the scenerio, refer to "Requirements.md".
